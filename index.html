  <h3><b>About us</b></h3>

  <p>We are Christians in Halifax who love the Lord Jesus and who desire to give Him the first place in
    all things. He is our love, our life, our everything!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b>Colossians 1:18b-19 </b>He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might
    have the first place in all things; For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell.
  </blockquote>

  <p>We are members of the universal Body of Christ, which includes all those who believe that Jesus
    Christ died for their sins and who call on Him as the living Lord of all. Here in Halifax, we meet
    in oneness with all believers in Christ as the church in Halifax.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b>1 Corinthians 12:12-13</b> For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members
    of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ. For also in one Spirit we were all
    baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink
    one Spirit.
  </blockquote>
